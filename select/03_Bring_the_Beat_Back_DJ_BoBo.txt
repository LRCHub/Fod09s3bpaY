Bring the beat back don't believe the hype
Bring the beat back don't believe the hype
Bring the beat back don't believe the hype
It's a jam and I do what I like
Bring the beat back don't believe the hype
Bring the beat back don't believe the hype
Bring the beat back don't believe the hype
It's a jam and I do what I like
Listen to my voice and start to dance
I promise you this will advance
I am back with my rhyme and I started to climb
Welcome to the jam I am rocking again
From my mind and my heart to your body and your feet
I know what you want it's that beat from the street
Mr. DJ put the jam on
Pump it up to till the night is done
Let's go down down to the underground
I'm kicking your back Bobo is in town
It's a jam and I do what I like
Bring the beat back don't believe the hype
You have the bass in the place together as one
Try to run then you're gonna have fun
I know what you want and you want it now
I know what you want when you hear the sound
Bring the beat back don't believe the hype
Bring the beat back don't believe the hype
Bring the beat back don't believe the hype
It's a jam and I do what I like
Bring the beat back don't believe the hype
Bring the beat back don't believe the hype
Bring the beat back don't believe the hype
It's a jam and I do what I like
If you try to beat you got to be a kid
And give the world your everything
I'm not the greatest dancer with the fastest tunes
I'm not the fastest rapper that you ever knew
By the way it sounds like a mystery
But no one knows who you really wanna be
Deep in the night I bring you delight
And leave all the troubles by your side
Bring the beat back don't believe the hype
Bring the beat back don't believe the hype
Bring the beat back don't believe the hype
It's a jam and I do what I like
Bring the beat back don't believe the hype
Bring the beat back don't believe the hype
Bring the beat back don't believe the hype
It's a jam and I do what I like
Bring the beat back don't believe the hype
Bring the beat back don't believe the hype
Bring the beat back don't believe the hype
It's a jam and I do what I like
Bring the beat back don't believe the hype
Bring the beat back don't believe the hype
Bring the beat back don't believe the hype
It's a jam and I do what I like
